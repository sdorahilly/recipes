    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a recipe for thai fried rice. It is actually really good, and a great way to use leftover rice!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>5 cups cooked jasmine rice, cooled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat and cook bacon until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving bacon grease in a bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons grease back into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high and cook garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato and pineapple and stir-fry until warmed through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and add 1 tablespoon bacon grease. Add rice and stir-fry, breaking up with a spatula so it gets coated well with bacon grease. Cook for about 3 minutes. Season with ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Move rice mixture to one side of the skillet or wok and pour beaten eggs onto the empty side. Stir-fry until eggs are almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix eggs with rice mixture. Fold in bacon bits. Serve with cucumber, green onions, cilantro, lemon wedges, and chile peppers.</li>
    </ol>
